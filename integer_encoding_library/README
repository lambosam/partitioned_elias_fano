An encoder/decoder collection for a sequence of integers
=================

Overview
-----------
This library is assumed to encode and decode a sequence of integers
with highly positive skewness. The skewness is a distribution where
the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left, i.e., an
element of the sequence is rarely a large integer. The library
includes a processor-friendly fast coder, called VSEncoder, and
other earlier coders for their comparisons.

NOTE: The library aims at a research tool for performance
benchmarks, not a qualified product. If you would like to use
